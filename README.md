# siwes-portal
We  developed the  e-SIWES portal  in order  to enhance  the manual  task  of  carrying  out  SIWES  activities  such  as registration, dissemination of information, 
filling of log book for studentsâ€™  day-to-day activities and supervision/assessment by lecturers and industry based supervisors. The portal is web-based and allows all 
tasks to be carried out using the personal computer and the  Internet. We digitized  the SIWES logbook and assessment forms for  filling by students  and grading by the 
supervisors electronically. This will  allow supervisors  to be  assigned  immediately  the  students  commence  their industrial training and facilitate their monitoring 
in real-time. With  the  e-SIWES  portal,  important  messages  can  be broadcast to all students at once and on a prompt and regular basis.
